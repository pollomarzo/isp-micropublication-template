# Description

In this section, we elaborate on our single claim, observation, or method being presented. Depending on the length of our Abstract, this section contains a maximum of 1350-1400 words.

We begin by providing context and background information, explaining why the research is important and what it aims to achieve. In the text, we remember to add citations to refer to the work of others, ensuring that proper credit is given and that the research is situated within the existing body of knowledge @pollockPracticalGuidanceCrafting2023. We do this using a bibliography file (`references.bib`), or linking directly to a DOI.

We continue by outlining our research approach, mentioning the datasets, tools, theoretical frameworks, and analytical methods we have used. This provides readers with the necessary information to understand and potentially replicate our work.

We then describe our results clearly, concisely, and in a logical order. We use a single high-resolution figure to support the findings and reference it in the text (@figure-main A).
